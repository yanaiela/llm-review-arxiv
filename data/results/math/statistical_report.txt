Total Papers Analyzed: 34645

Post-LLM Review Papers:
  Count: 962

ALPHA COMPARISON (Post-LLM Period)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Raw Alpha Estimates:
  Review Papers: α = 0.0160 (95% CI: [0.0110, 0.0210])
  Regular Papers: α = 0.0050 (95% CI: [0.0040, 0.0060])

  Absolute Difference: 0.0110
  Relative Increase: 220.0%
  Confidence Intervals Overlap: False

Rogan-Gladen Adjusted Alpha Estimates:
  Review Papers: α_adj = 0.0150 (95% CI: [0.0100, 0.0200])
  Regular Papers: α_adj = 0.0050 (95% CI: [0.0040, 0.0060])

  Absolute Difference (Adjusted): 0.0100
  Relative Increase (Adjusted): 200.3%
  Confidence Intervals Overlap (Adjusted): False


BASELINE CHECK (Pre-LLM Papers)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Review Papers FPR: 0.0010 ± 0.0010 (n=956)
  Regular Papers FPR: 0.0000 (n=16630)

  Average FPR: 0.0000
  Acceptable: True


GROUP-LEVEL ALPHA ESTIMATES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: Alpha is a distributional property measuring the fraction of AI-generated
content across an entire cohesive dataset (group), not individual papers.

Pre-LLM Period (False Positive Rates):
  Review: α = 0.0010 ± 0.0010
  Regular: α = 0.0000 ± 0.0000

Post-LLM Period (Raw Estimates):
  Review: α = 0.0160 ± 0.0050
  Regular: α = 0.0050 ± 0.0010

Post-LLM Period (Rogan-Gladen Adjusted):
  Review: α_adj = 0.0150 (-6.2% change)
  Regular: α_adj = 0.0050 (+0.0% change)

  Adjustment removes false positive baseline from pre-LLM period.

CONCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review/survey papers show a higher proportion of AI-generated content
compared to regular research papers in the post-LLM era.
The relative increase is approximately 200.3%.
The confidence intervals do not overlap, suggesting a meaningful difference.
